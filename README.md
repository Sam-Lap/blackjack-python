# Terminal-Based BLACKJACK Project
## Description
This terminal program is based off of the standard Blackjack rules and implemented in Python. It simulates the game and allows the player to play against an automated dealer. 

## Features
- Terminal-based user interface
- Basic Blackjack game actions: hit / stand
- Tracks player balance
- Automated dealer following standard Blackjack rules

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
### Setup
1. Clone the repository in terminal:
   
   `git clone https://github.com/Sam-Lap/terminal-blackjack.git`
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   `cd terminal-blackjack`

## How to Play
- Run the game using Python:
  
  `python main.py`

Follow the on-screen prompts to place bets, choose actions, and play multiple rounds of Blackjack.
The dealer will automatically play according to standard Blackjack rules.

## Rules
- The goal of Blackjack is to get your hand's value as close to 21 (without passing it) and to have a higher hand value than the dealer.
- Number cards are worth their respective face value. Face cards are worth 10. Aces can have a value of either 1 or 11.
- A bet can be placed on each round. Winning the round returns the player double their bet. Losing the round results in the loss of the bet.
- The 'hit' action will deal your hand a single randomly generated card from the deck. The player can continuously 'hit' until they either are content with their hand's value or they go over 21 and 'bust' (lose the round).
- <sup>*</sup>Only one of the dealer's hand cards will be face-up, use this information to decide your action!
